# Unblocked Games website

## Description:
Another unblocked games website. Though this one looks like it was copied straight from tag-2, I hand coded the styles and files (I only took the games from other websites). I sometimes change the address and name to counter getting blocked by Cisco.

## Website features:
* Redirects to Google drive after 200 seconds 🕙
* (soon to be public) Search tab 🔎
* Fulscreen for games ⇱
* Favicon and title desgised as canvas dashboard 🤫
* Includes banger games like **Super Mario 64**, **Super Hot** and **Drift Hunters** 🤘
* Ad free games for ever (I know, i'm so nice.) 🚫
* Quick Switch for redirecting to Google Drive manually (by pressing 'q' on the home page) ⚡

## Usage:
Just go to the current link and play whatever you want. If you want to fork, please give me some credit. I worked hard on this.

## Contributing:
I would be very greatful if someone took the time to help me with this project. I've been working on this for WAY too long by myself.
